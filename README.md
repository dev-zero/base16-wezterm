# base16-wezterm

A set of [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) scheme templates for
the [wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) terminal emulator. These
templates can be used with any compliant Base16 builder. **Pre-built** schemes
are also available in the [`colors`](https://github.com/dev-zero/base16-wezterm/tree/master/colors)
directory of this repository for convenience.

## Installation
